# exogenesis-pitchdeck
Pitchdeck for a tech event called Exogenesis

This is a pitchdeck which I created which analyzes the logistics and aspects of a tech event for young students at a massive scale. I already created a website for it and you can view it at https://exogenesis-hackclub.vercel.app/

I used blender for the 3d and figma for the 2d in this pitchdeck aswell as designing the UI for the website itself.
